Current stage:

Block and Chain objects exist.

Nodes have the ability to receive data and mine that data into blocks.

Working P2P system, in which each node broadcasts its blockchain, and all nodes sync to the longest chain.  App has the ability to accept environment variables for HTTP_PORT and P2P_PORT, allowing one machine to run concurrent instances of the app for demonstration/testing purposes.

Next will be a PoW system for mining blocks to secure the network.

Special thanks to David Katz for his instruction.
